            Cats are fascinating animals and surrounded by mysteries. In
             independent and mysterious temperament, these felines are known
             for its agility, elegance and behavior that is often
             unpredictable. However, recently, a theory has gained ground
             on the internet and among conspiracy theorists: it would be cats
             astronauts? <br />
            The theory suggests that cats are not land animals, but rather
             extraterrestrial beings sent to carry out a specific mission
             on our planet. There are historical reports that point to the fact that
             that cats were considered sacred beings in different cultures
             and even associated with divine figures. This could indicate that
             cats have a much more mystical origin than previously thought
             previously. <br />
            <br />
            In addition, there are theorists who believe that felines have
             telepathic abilities and are able to communicate with others
             alien species. This belief is based on reports from people
             who claim to have seen cats reacting to stimuli that are not
             perceptible to human beings, or even behaving in
             unusual way during astronomical events such as an aurora
             boreal. These and other indications were interpreted as signs of
             that cats would be interplanetary beings.
